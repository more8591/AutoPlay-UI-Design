# AutoPlay-UI-Design
An app that allows the user to view videos on their infotainment screen while stationary. GPS will detect if the user is driving or not. If user is driving, the app will disable functionality util user is fully stationary. GPS cannot be turned off while using this app to ensure full safety of the driver. This is a rough sketch of the apps UI/UX.
